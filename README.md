# Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) - Building from Scratch

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of an artificial neural network (ANN) from scratch using Python and NumPy. The primary objective is to approximate a target function through supervised learning on synthetic data. The network is structured as a feedforward neural network trained using backpropagation.

## Key Features
- Implementation of a neural network with multiple hidden layers
- Utilization of ReLU activation functions
- Xavier initialization for stable weight initialization
- Customizable architecture (input size, hidden size, layers, and learning rate)
- Performance evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R2 Score, and accuracy

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone the repository and ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.

## Prerequisites
Install the required dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Code Breakdown
### 1. Imports and Setup
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error, r2_score
```
The project uses essential Python libraries for data manipulation and evaluation metrics.

### 2. Target Function
```python
def target_function(x, y, z):
    return -(x**2 + 2*y**2 + 3*z**2)
```
The target function calculates outputs based on three inputs (x, y, z). This function is used to generate training and testing data.

### 3. Data Generation
```python
def generate_data(num_samples=100000):
    x = np.random.uniform(-1, 1, size=(num_samples, 1))
    y = np.random.uniform(-1, 1, size=(num_samples, 1))
    z = np.random.uniform(-1, 1, size=(num_samples, 1))
    inputs = np.hstack((x, y, z))
    outputs = target_function(x, y, z)
    return inputs, outputs
```
Random data points within [-1, 1] are generated for model training and testing.

### 4. Neural Network Class
```python
class NeuralNetwork:
    def __init__(self, input_size=3, hidden_size=64, output_size=1, num_hidden_layers=2, learning_rate=0.01):
        ...
```
The neural network class initializes key components, including:
- Input size (3 for x, y, z)
- Hidden size (default 64 neurons per layer)
- Output size (1 for scalar output)
- Number of hidden layers (default is 2)
- Learning rate (0.01 by default)

### 5. Activation Functions
```python
def relu(self, x):
    return np.maximum(0, x)

def relu_derivative(self, x):
    return (x > 0).astype(float)
```
ReLU is applied for hidden layer activation, and its derivative is used during backpropagation.

### 6. Forward Pass
```python
def forward(self, X):
    ...
```
The forward pass computes the activations at each layer, storing them for the backward pass.

### 7. Backpropagation
```python
def backward(self, X, y, predictions):
    ...
```
The backward pass calculates gradients for weights and biases by propagating errors backward through the network.

### 8. Training
```python
def train(self, X, y, epochs=1000):
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        predictions = self.forward(X)
        self.backward(X, y, predictions)
        loss = mean_squared_error(y, predictions)
        if epoch % 100 == 0:
            print(f"Epoch {epoch}, Loss: {loss:.4f}")
```
The network is trained for a specified number of epochs with periodic logging of the loss.

### 9. Evaluation Metrics
```python
def calculate_exponential_accuracy(real_outputs, predicted_exponents):
    ...
```
Performance is evaluated using MSE, MAE, R2 Score, and accuracy based on the exponential of predictions.

### 10. Main Execution
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    inputs, outputs = generate_data(10000)
    ...
```
The main block generates data, trains the neural network, and evaluates performance.

## Training and Evaluation
- **Training Set**: 80% of the generated data
- **Testing Set**: 20% of the generated data
- Model performance is measured on unseen testing data.

### Sample Output
```bash
Test Metrics:
MSE: 0.0123, MAE: 0.0456, R2: 0.9876, Accuracy: 93.45%
```

## Results
- The neural network demonstrates high accuracy in approximating the target function.
- Performance metrics confirm minimal error and reliable predictions.

## Running the Project
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies.
3. Run the neural network script:
```bash
